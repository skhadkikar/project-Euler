# project-Euler
so much math

here i've put all the project Euler problems that i've done. problems number 100+ do not have their code published by project Euler guidelines. user siddharthk_21 at https://projecteuler.net. unpublished answers: 104, 111, 149, 206.

many of the text files that i used for the problems aren't uploaded, but the code files do contain commented out code for recreating those text files. 

in progress: 212, 384
